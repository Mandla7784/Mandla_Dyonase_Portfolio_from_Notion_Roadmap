If "npm install" fails with "Invalid Version" or "next is not recognized":

RUN ONCE (in PowerShell, from the project folder C:\Dev):

  .\setup-and-build.ps1

That script will clear the devdir config, install deps, and build. After it succeeds once, you can use "npm run dev" and "npm run build" normally.

MANUAL FIX (if the script fails):

1. Open a NEW PowerShell window (outside Cursor).
2. Clear config and env, then install:
   npm config delete devdir
   npm config delete version
   cd C:\Dev
   npm install
   npm run build

3. If "Invalid Version" still appears, use pnpm instead (bypasses npm):
   npm install -g pnpm
   cd C:\Dev
   pnpm install
   pnpm run build
   (Then use "pnpm run dev" to start the app.)

4. Last resort: open %USERPROFILE%\.npmrc in Notepad and remove any line with "devdir" or "version=". Save and try npm install again.
